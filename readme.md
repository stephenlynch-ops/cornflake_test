## User goals

The user can then move onto the next question when they are ready to do so by pressing 'Enter'.

# Testing

## Code validation

The code was tested using pep8online.com with no errors or warnings.

### Issues found during testing

When the app was deployed on Heroku, i didn't like that there was no padding betweent the forst character of the text in each line and the edge of the command line window. So 2 spaces were input to each text line, to help the user to follow the text.

### Performance testing

To check the user feedback to the data collected, the data was changed to test for accurate outcomes. There were a couple of errors found early on, for example if 100% of people would try a new cereal the app missed this as still gave a positive outcome (i.e. There is room for a new cereal).

These were modified an no further errors were found.
